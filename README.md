## Overview
A simple Java simulation of the game show "The Traitors," calculating the probability of traitors winning against faithfuls.

## Running the Simulation
1. **Setup**: Ensure Java (JDK 8 or later) is installed on your system.
2. **Compilation**: Compile the Java file.
   ```shell
   javac TraitorSimulation.java
java TraitorSimulation
