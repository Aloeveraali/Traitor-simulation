# TraitorSimulation

## Overview
A simple Java simulation of the game show "The Traitors," calculating the probability of traitors winning against faithfuls.

## Running the Simulation
1. **Setup**: Ensure Java (JDK 8 or later) is installed on your system.
2. **Compilation**: Compile the Java file.
   ```shell
   javac TraitorSimulation.java
java TraitorSimulation

## How It Works
Simulates the game with a set number of traitors and faithfuls. Each simulation randomly decides nightly eliminations and calculates the winning probability for traitors over numerous iterations.

## Customization
Modify nTraitors in the main method to simulate different numbers of traitors.
